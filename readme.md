# Banking Case Study - Loan & Income Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes customer income insights and loan-less customer profiles using statistical analysis and machine learning models. The goal is to identify patterns and trends that help in predicting loan eligibility and customer segmentation.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset provided in an Excel file (Banking Case - Data.xlsx). The dataset contains customer-related attributes, including income, loan status, and demographic details.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze customer income distribution and its impact on loans.

- Profile customers who do not have loans.

- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.

- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models for prediction.

- Conduct statistical tests for insights.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

### Libraries:

- Data Handling: pandas, numpy

- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

- Machine Learning: sklearn, xgboost

- Statistical Analysis: scipy

## Implementation Steps

- Data Loading: Read the dataset from the Excel file.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand key patterns.

- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features for better predictions.

- Model Training & Evaluation: Train multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and KNN.

- Statistical Analysis: Perform chi-square tests and other statistical methods to derive insights.

## Results

Identified key income groups that are more/less likely to take loans.
Developed predictive models with accuracy and performance metrics.
Found significant patterns in loan-less customer profiles.
